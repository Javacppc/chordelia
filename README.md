chordelia
=========

Chordelia is a tool for generating chord based material for composers not wanting to write - only - within the barriers of functional harmonies.

As of now, 2015, the codebase is in state of transition a) from Google Code b) from old Spring-Hibernate to new Spring-Hibernate-JPA.

See http://karstengresch.github.io/chordelia/ (not nicely formatted yet).
