# Future plans, support needed!

= Road Map for chordelia =

== Server side ==
  * Refactoring: German stuff out, English in.
  * Extract properties of _spring-main.xml_ to _`*`.properties_ files.
  * Enhance test cases.
  * Introduce code coverage.
  * Support individual projects.
  * Support multi-reservoirs (i.e. several results of permutations).
  * Support interruption of calculation.
  * Support integrity checks.
  * Check performance enhancements (especially batch runs, transactional stuff, parallel actions).
  * Implementation that is not dependend on index based locking.
  * Eventually move to Scala.

== Client side ==
  * Eclipse GUI: Eclipse is _the_ platform for score creation and working with musical symbols.
