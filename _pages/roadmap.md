  * Introduce code coverage.
  * Support individual projects.
  * Support multi-reservoirs (i.e. several results of permutations).
  * Support interruption of calculation.
  * Support integrity checks.
  * Check performance enhancements (especially batch runs, transactional stuff, parallel actions).
  * Implementation that is not dependend on index based locking.
  * Eventually move to Scala.
